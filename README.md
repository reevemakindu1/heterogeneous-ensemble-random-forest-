Ensemble approaches integrate the predictions of many base estimators produced using a particular learning algorithm in order to boost resilience in comparison to 
utilizing a single estimator. Ensemble approaches are the most effective for regression and classification because they reduce bias and variance while boosting model 
accuracy.
The two ensemble methods are boosting and bagging. The bagging approach will be the main emphasis of this study because the Random Forest model depends on it.
In order to get the model average, bagging is a homogenous weak learner's model that connects the several simultaneous learnings.
This project will utilize a dataset on bank churn.
Building ensemble models using the provided dataset, like Random Forest, is the goal of this research in order to predict whether or not a customer would leave.
Python will be the language utilized for this project.
The necessary libraries are imported first.
Next, the dataset is read.
There is a split in the train test.
A Random Forest model will be employed for the model construction.
The process for determining a feature's importance is to build a function, identify key features, then plot those features.
